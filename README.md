# SurveyInsight-YouGov
This tool is built using Python with Streamlit and Plotly, to extend the analysis of YouGov survey datasets, in a better way.

## Why a new tool?

The visualization YouGov provides is for a single group of people only, as shown in the screenshot below. So we cannot compare more than one group of people with each other.

So, I needed a tool that compares more than group of people, in fact ANY number of groups of people, with each other.
I also wanted to create a set of better suited charts for this use case. That is where this comes to the scene! And the result?

## Result:
