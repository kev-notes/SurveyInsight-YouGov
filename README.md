# SurveyInsight-YouGov
➜ This tool is built using Python with Streamlit and Plotly, to extend the analysis of YouGov survey datasets, in a better way.
➜ You can choose ANY number of the groups of people for comparison and analysis and for any given date range. You can configure the responses you'd like to view.
➜ You can use any dataset from YouGov, as long as it is in the same format as the provided example.

## Why a new tool?

The visualization YouGov provides is for a single group of people only, as seen here: https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/support-for-businesses-publishing-salary-ranges

So I needed a tool that compares more than group of people, in fact ANY number of groups of people, with each other.
I also wanted to create a set of better suited charts for this use case. That is where this comes to the scene! And the result?

## Status of this project

I don't plan to update this project frequently. However I am open to any suggestions.
